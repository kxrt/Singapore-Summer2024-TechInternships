<h2>Step 1: Find an internship to add</h2>

* The internship must be for a technology-focused role.
* The internship company must be located in Singapore, and the role should be targeted almost exclusively towards applicants in Singapore.
* The company should not already exist in the internship list.
* The internship period **must** overlap somewhat with May-Jul 2024. This allows for ATAP postings to be included too.

<h2>Step 2: Insert the posting</h2>

* The internship posting must be formatted in the following manner:

```Markdown
| CompanyName | RoleName | [Open](ApplicationLink) | CurrentDate (dd MMM yyyy) |
```
* If a `RoleName` contains the `|` character, escape it (`\|`).
* For examples, please refer to the [internship list](README.md).
* Note that **alphabetical order** of the company names is enforced, to standardize the internship posting list.
* If an internship closes accepting applications, the application status should change to `CLOSED` without a link.

<h3>Step 3: Create a Pull Request</h3>

* Ideally, please follow conventional commits - start the commit message with `roles:` to add/edit an internship role.
* Add the internship to the list, and create a [pull request](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/).
* Once I review your submission, it will be merged in.
